Things to update: -- 

Validation and Correction: The validate_eulerian_circuit function is a placeholder and does not implement a method to correct a non-Eulerian circuit into an Eulerian one. This is crucial for the GA to work correctly.

Crossover and Mutation Logic: The ordered_crossover and mutate functions have simplistic implementations that might not maintain the Eulerian property. These would need to be more robust in a full solution.

WoC Integration: might need to include a mechanism where solutions from multiple GAs or parts of solutions (sub-circuits) are combined to form a better solution.

Error Handling: 


Improved GUI that is accurate.
